# notes

- Install SONY sdk [in few steps](https://developer.sony.com/develop/wearables/smarteyeglass-sdk/get-started/)
- To use sdk, import `(sony sdk path)/samples/SmartExtensionAPI` as a module using `ADT project`
- Also import `(sony sdk path)/samples/SmartExtensionUtils`
- Need reconnect accessory to make extension available, dunno why
